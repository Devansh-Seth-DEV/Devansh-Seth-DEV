# üí´ About Me
As a passionate and curious **B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student with a specialization in IoT, Cybersecurity, and Blockchain**, I‚Äôve always believed in learning by doing and teaching others. Whether it's system design, backend development, or building immersive user experiences in iOS, I love solving real-world problems through tech.

Recently, I led a 9-member team as a **Scrum Master** and **Backend Developer** during my **Infosys internship**. We developed **InFleet Express**, a full-stack **Fleet Management iOS app** in 1 month ‚Äî designed using Supabase, Swift, and geofencing-based trip handling.

What sets me apart is my blend of:
- Backend Development using Supabase, SQL, and serverless logic.
- iOS App Development with Swift, custom data models, and clean architecture.
- Leadership & Agile project handling using Jira & sprint planning.
- A deep love for C++, Python, and system-level understanding.

I'm also developing a mental wellness a virtual companion app, combining role-play, gamified learning paths, and behavioral personalization ‚Äî helping young adults grow socially and emotionally.

I‚Äôm always open to networking, mentorship, and opportunities that challenge me to level up.

Currently I am actively maintain a GitHub repository ‚Äî [DSA-Playground](https://github.com/Devansh-Seth-DEV/DSA-Playground) ‚Äî where I consistently solve and implement advanced DSA concepts, including handcrafted problems and reusable segment trees.

My approach to learning is by doing, observing, and teaching others ‚Äî and I enjoy turning complex ideas into practical, real-world tools.
